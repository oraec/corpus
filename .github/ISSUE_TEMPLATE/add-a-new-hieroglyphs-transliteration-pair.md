Our **Hieroglyphs to Transliteration** converter uses a list with hieroglyphs-transliteration pairs. You can improve our converter by adding a new pair. E.g. Currently our list does not know the string 𓁹𓅃. Please add "𓁹𓅃:jr,t-Ḥr,w". So, type first your hieroglyphic string, then the :, and then your transliteration. We will check it and add it to our list. Many thanks!
